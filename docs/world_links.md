# World Links — Cross-Area Room Connections

This document catalogs all known cross-area exits: room exits whose destination vnum falls outside the source area's own `V` envelope. Use this as the authoritative reference when adding, removing, or auditing world connections. Never verify cross-area links by reading individual `.are` files; update this document instead.

**Status key:**
- **Active** — both sides of the link are live and bidirectional.
- **One-way** — only one side of the link currently exists.
- **Deprecated** — a link that existed in a prior version and whose source side has been removed, but the destination side in the external area still exists (orphaned).
- **Planned** — a link defined in an area plan but not yet built.

## Midgaard (917–1116)

Room 1106 ("The Southern Wild Gate") in `midgaard.are` has exit D2 (south) destination `0 -1 1434`. The reverse (`wood` 1434 north → 1106) must be maintained in `wood.are`.

## Eccentric Woodland — wood.are (1432–1831)

### Canonical Links (must be maintained)

| From | Dir | To | Notes | Status |
|------|-----|----|-------|--------|
| `wood` 1434 | north | `midgaard` 1106 | Woodland entry ↔ Southern Wild Gate | Active |
| `wood` 1830 | south | `rakuen` 4239 | Woodland south exit ↔ Rakuen North Dispatch Gate | Active |
| `rakuen` 4239 | north | `wood` 1830 | Rakuen North Dispatch Gate ↔ Woodland south exit | Active |

The north link (`1434 ↔ 1106`) is the primary canonical entry and must never be removed without updating `midgaard.are` room 1106 D2.

The south link (`1830 ↔ 4239`) is bidirectional: `wood` 1830 D2(south) → 4239 and `rakuen` 4239 D0(north) → 1830.

### Legacy Links from Old wood.are (Deprecated by Rebuild)

The old `wood.are` (vnums 1432–1531) had bidirectional cross-area connections that were removed when `wood.are` was rebuilt. Two external areas that still exist retain orphaned exits pointing into the woodland; those exits land in rooms with different names and no reverse connection.

| External Area | Ext Room | Dir | Destination | Old Woodland Room Purpose | Status |
|--------------|----------|-----|-------------|--------------------------|--------|
| `sunken_sanctum` 2266 | D2 (south) | → | `wood` 1455 | Old woodland side-exit (sanctum passage) | **Deprecated** |
| `kelshadra` 2232 | D0 (north) | → | `wood` 1456 | Old woodland side-exit (Kel'Shadra passage) | **Deprecated** |
| `kelshadra` 2232 | D4 (up) | → | `wood` 1456 | Same destination as D0 above; second exit in same room | **Deprecated** |

**Action required (future work):** Each external area listed above should have its inbound exits to the woodland removed or redirected. Until that cleanup occurs, players using those exits will arrive in a Zone A/B room in the new Eccentric Woodland with no return path.

## Forest Cluster — confusn / verdantgreen / withered_depths / great_northern_forest

The Forest of Confusion (2339–2538), Verdant Depths (2739–2938), Withered Depths, and Great Northern Forest (3739–4238) are all part of the same continental forest system. All cross-area exits within this cluster are bidirectional.

| `great_northern_forest` 3739 | south | `confusn` 2537 | Great Northern Forest ↔ Forest of Confusion | Active |

**Note:** `withered_depths` room 291 has two exits pointing to `confusn` 2434: D0 (north) and D3 (west). Both land in the same room. Only D0 is the canonical reverse of `confusn` 2434 D2 (south).

**Note:** All Cinderteeth links below are Planned status. The `cinderteeth_mountains.are` area (vnums 6124-6723) is not yet built. `confusn` 2519/2521/2524 do not yet exist in `confusn.are` and must be added. GNF rooms 4179/4199/4219 exist in the plan but need `west` exits added. `sunken_sanctum` 2266 exists and needs its TBD exit resolved to `up` → 6552.
