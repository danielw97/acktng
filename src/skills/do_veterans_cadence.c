/*
 * Veteran's Cadence — Crusader (CLASS_CRU) Level 10
 *
 * Expresses the Crusader tradition's campaign-service origin: practitioners
 * who remained in the field through sustained engagements developed a rhythm
 * that built effectiveness over time rather than spending it.  Each activation
 * adds a stacking DAMROLL bonus (up to three stacks); the bonuses fade when
 * combat ends, representing momentum that only compounds through sustained
 * engagement.
