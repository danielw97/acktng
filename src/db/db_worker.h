/* db_worker.h — Async database worker thread for ACK!TNG.
 *
 * The MUD runs a single-threaded game loop; any synchronous libpq call would
 * block select() and lag all players.  This module provides a background
 * thread that owns the runtime PGconn* and processes a lock-protected queue
 * of read/write operations.
 *
 * Boot-time loads (areas, rooms, mobiles, etc.) are synchronous and use
 * db_conn.h directly, before game_loop() starts.
 *
 * Runtime flow:
 *   - Game thread calls db_worker_enqueue_write() or
 *     db_worker_enqueue_load_player() and returns immediately.
 *   - Worker thread wakes, executes the DB operation, posts results.
 *   - Game thread calls db_worker_poll_results() each tick to pick up
 *     completed player loads and advance the login state machine.
 *
 * Compiled only when HAVE_LIBPQ is defined.
